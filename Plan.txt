-Set up a Button and Text box for ease of use later
-Set up a text file whith the short forms typed out and translated
-Set up a vairables in two seperate arrays to find the Short form then translate it to the code,
- This will look like this:

string[] ShortForm;
string[] TranslatedText;
ShortForm = new string[1];
TranslatedText = new string[1];
ShortForm[0] = "TTYL";
TranslatedText[0] = "talk to you later";
ShortForm[1] = "CCC";
TranslatedText[1] = "Canadian Computing Competition";

for (int i = 0; i < ShortForm.Length; i++)
{
 MessageBox.Show (TranslatedText[i]);
}

-Add a if statement inside the for loop to stop it after reading the first value correctly
-Like so:

if (ShortForm[i] == InputBox.Text)
                {
                    MessageBox.Show(TranslatedText[i]);
                }

-Set it to stop after finding TTYL, only reading the array numbers for the Values that have been typed
